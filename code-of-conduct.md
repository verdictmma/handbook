# Verdict Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an inclusive and safe workplace, Verdict pledges to be a harassment- and discrimination-free space for everyone, regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, nationality, neurotype, personal appearance, political affiliation, professional background, race, religion, or sexual identity or orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a healthy environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful and empathetic when it comes to differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting and offering constructive criticism and feedback

Examples of unacceptable behavior by employees include:

- The use of any sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Insulting or derogatory comments
- Discriminating on the basis of age, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, nationality, neurotype, personal appearance, political affiliation, professional background, race, religion, or sexual identity or orientation.
- Public or private harassment
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities
Managers are responsible for upholding these standards. They will be clear and equitable when applying standards of acceptable behavior. They’re required to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. If you have questions about the standards above, talk to your manager or to Andrea.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within Verdict during work hours and in public spaces when you’re representing Verdict. Examples of representing Verdict in a public space include acting as a delegate at an online or offline event like a conference, posting on Verdict branded social media, or participating in a Verdict social event outside of work hours.

## Daily Fantasy Sports Limitations
We are big believers in [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food). It's the path to creating the best possible product. We want to be able to feel what the user feels when they lose or win money. Unfortunately, in the past, players have been caught using internal metrics to place picks for fantasy lineups within other apps. Regulators referred to this as "insider trading", although, your opinion may differ. We're required to place several restrictions on employees because of this that are codified in our [Terms of Service](https://verdictmma.com/terms) and are specifically highlighted in the excerpt below:

> 14. Ineligible Persons

> For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “Unauthorized Person” means (a) any officer, director,
employee, consultant or agent of the Company or one of its affiliated or subsidiary companies, or a
supplier or vendor to the Company, or (b) any relative living in the same household as any Unauthorized
Person (an “Immediate Family Member”). Subject to the exception in the following paragraph,
Unauthorized Persons are not permitted to register to participate directly or indirectly in any of the
Contests. The Company will withhold any and all winnings to be paid to persons who are in breach of
this provision.

**Note the exception below that enables dogfooding:**
> Exception: Unless otherwise prohibited by local laws, Unauthorized Persons may be permitted to play in
Contests which are not listed within the Distribution Channels and are hosted by other participating
Unauthorized Persons.

> The following additional persons are also prohibited from participating in the contests: (i) any employee
or operator of any daily fantasy site including any that charges entrance fees or offers prizes, and any
Immediate Family Member of any such person; (ii) any person who has (or has had) access to any pre-
release, confidential information or other information that is not available to all other Contest
participants (&quot;Pre-Release Data&quot;); (iii) any employee of a sponsor, consultant or supplier of the
Company or any other daily fantasy sports contest provider that has access to Pre-Release Data or
otherwise receives an advantage in the entrant&#39;s participation in a Contest; (iv) any employee, operator
or consultant to a sports governing body where such employee, operator or consultant is prohibited from
participating in applicable Contests by such governing body; (v) any person prohibited from
participating pursuant to court order; (vi) any person who has knowingly received Pre-Release Data or
any other non-public information that provides an advantage in a Contest from any person who is
prohibited from entering a Contest as provided in this Agreement; or (vii) any person who engages in
improper conduct, as described in Section 14 of this Agreement.
Professional or amateur athletes, sports agents, coaches, team owners, team employees, referees or
league officials, and their Immediate Family Members, are not eligible to participate in, and are strictly
prohibited from entering, any Contests in the sport in which they are associated.

## Enforcement
If you notice someone acting inappropriately as described in the standards above, you can report it by contacting your manager or Andrea. Or you can complete a [complaint form](https://3.verdictmma.com/2914079/buckets/34/documents/2006612007). You may choose to remain anonymous on the complaint form.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is appropriate to the circumstances. Managers are required maintain your confidentiality however you choose to report an incident.

After your complaint has been reviewed, investigated, and responded to, Andrea or your manager will inform you of the steps being taken to address the original issue and any disciplinary outcomes.

In addition, all valid complaints about employees will be documented in a permanent file, along with related investigation processes and disciplinary outcomes. Repeated complaints about one employee will result in escalating disciplinary measures, up to and including termination.

Managers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith will be subject to corrective action as well.
